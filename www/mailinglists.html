<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
SwingLabs provides a shared mailing list for both user and developer related
issues across all core sub-projects (swingx, databinding, jdnc, 
demos and incubator). The shared list has a gateway to and from the 
<a href="https://swinglabs.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView">shared discussion forum</a>, 
so theoretically you can choose to follow and contribute to all discussions either via the mailinglist
or via the web form (practically the gateway is broken occasionally, so watch out!)
</p>

<p>Similarly, SwingLabs provides a shared mailing list for announcements (TBD-JW: which one??)
</p>

<p>Besides, there are per-project mailinglists to get notified about changes
to cvs and/or issues.
</p>

<h3>Shared Lists </h3>

<p>For historical reasons the 
<a href="https://jdnc.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingLists">shared discussion list</a> 
resides under the jdnc subproject. The
list to subscribe to is named "jdnc". Note that you have to join the jdnc subproject to
be able to subscribe.
</p>

<h3>Project Specific Lists </h3>

<p>If you are interested in keeping up-to-date with current changes in the version control
cvs and/or the issue tracker, you can subscribe to one or both of the 
<a href="https://swingx.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingLists">project specific lists</a>.
Both are meant to be read-only - that's not formally enforced, but writing to any of those
is unlikely to draw a response. 
Note that you have to join this project be be able to subcribe.
