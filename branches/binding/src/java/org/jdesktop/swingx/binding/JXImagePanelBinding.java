/**
 * Hmmmm....
 * The problem here is that the data in the image panel could be bits, image url,
 * etc. In fact, there isn't just one data type that I want to support, but a few
 * of them. That is, if I get a String, then it is a URL of some kind. If I get
 * an ImageIcon, us that, a BufferedImage, use that, a set of bytes, then use
 * that.
