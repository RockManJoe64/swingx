/** A trivial extension to TreeWillExpandListener, to allow listeners to be
 * notified if another TreeWillExpandListener vetos a pending expansion.
 * If a TreeExpansionListener added to an instance of TreePathSupport implements
 * this interface, it will be notified by the TreePathSupport if some other
 * listener vetos expanding a node.
 * <p>
 * This interface is primarily used to avoid memory leaks if a TreeWillExpandListener
 * constructs some data structure (like a TableModelEvent that is a translation
 * of a TreeExpansionEvent) for use when the expansion actually occurs, to notify
 * it that the pending TableModelEvent will never be fired.  It is not of much
 * interest to the rest of the world.
