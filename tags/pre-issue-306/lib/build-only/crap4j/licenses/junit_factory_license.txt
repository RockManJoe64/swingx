JUNIT FACTORY ECLIPSE PLUGIN
END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (“EULA”)

THIS AGREEMENT PERMITS THE USE OF AGITAR’S JUNIT FACTORY ECLIPSE PLUGIN SOFTWARE (THE
“SOFTWARE”), WHICH IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCT WHICH TRANSMITS CODE WITHOUT SECURITY TO
AGITAR’S SERVERS.

THIS SOFTWARE IS INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR ACADEMIC, RESEARCH, AND OPEN SOURCE
USE.  WHILE COMMERCIAL USE IS ALLOWED, PLEASE BE AWARE THAT YOUR CODE
IS TRANSMITTED OVER THE OPEN INTERNET AND ANALYZED ON NON-SECURE
COMPUTERS SHARED BY MULTIPLE USERS.

READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY!

BY CLICKING ON THE “I AGREE” BUTTON OR INSTALLING OR USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ARE
ACCEPTING ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. YOU AGREE THAT THIS
AGREEMENT IS ENFORCEABLE LIKE ANY WRITTEN NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT SIGNED BY YOU.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, CLICK “I DON’T AGREE”. YOU WILL
NOT BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE SOFTWARE UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

IF YOU WISH TO USE THE SOFTWARE AS AN EMPLOYEE, CONTRACTOR, OR AGENT OF A CORPORATION,
PARTNERSHIP OR SIMILAR ENTITY, THEN YOU MUST BE AUTHORIZED TO SIGN FOR AND BIND THE ENTITY
IN ORDER TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE LICENSES GRANTED UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON ACCEPTANCE BY SUCH AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL.

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE IS CONSIDERED “AGITAR DISTRIBUTABLE
SOFTWARE” AND IF YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH
AGITAR, THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NOT THOSE TERMS, APPLY TO THE SOFTWARE.

This End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between Agitar Software, Inc. located at 450 National Avenue,
Suite A, Mountain View, CA 94043 (“Agitar”) and the customer (individual or entity) that has obtained the Software for
use as an end user (“you”). This Agreement covers any Software and any supporting documentation provided with the
Software (“Documentation”).

1.	Use with JUnit Factory Service.

1.1	JUnit Factory Service. The Software uses Agitar’s JUnit Factory service (the “Service”), which the Software
contacts over the Internet. The Software connects with the Service and transmits your code to the Service which
analyzes your code and sends JUnit tests back to the Software. Communication between the Software and the
Service, as well as the Service itself, is inherently insecure and by using the software you agree that any code used
with the Software could be made public.

1.2	Additional Terms. You may also submit code to the Service directly via Agitar’s web site for the Service, and
since the Service may receive code both via the Software and directly through a web browser, the Service itself has
its own terms of service (the “Terms of Service”). This Agreement incorporates the Terms of Service, and your use of
the Software is subject to those terms as well.

1.3	No Guarantee of Future Availability. The Software and Service are experimental. Agitar does not commit to
making them available for any specified amount of time, and may cease offering either or both at any time. If Agitar
ceases offering the Service, the Software will not operate. You agree that you have no expectation that the Software
or Service will be available for any specified amount of time.

2.	License.

2.1	Grant of License. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Agitar grants you a non-
transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use one copy of the Software, but only in accordance with
the Documentation and this Agreement solely until such time as Agitar ceases to offer the Software and the Service.
You may also make a reasonable number of copies of the Software for back-up and archival purposes.

2.2	 License Restrictions. You shall not (and shall not allow any third party to): (a) decompile, disassemble, or
otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code, underlying ideas,
algorithms, file formats or programming interfaces of the Software by any means whatsoever (except and only to the
extent that applicable law prohibits or restricts reverse engineering restrictions);(b) distribute, sell, sublicense, rent,
lease or use the Software (or any portion thereof) for time sharing, hosting, service provider or like purposes; (c)
remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices contained in the Software; (d) modify any
part of the Software, create a derivative work of any part of the Software, or incorporate the Software into or with other
software, except to the extent expressly authorized in writing by Agitar; or (e) publicly disseminate performance
information or analysis (including, without limitation, benchmarks) from any source relating to the Software.

3.	Ownership. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except for the limited license rights
expressly provided herein, Agitar and its suppliers have and will retain all rights, title and interest (including, without
limitation, all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Software
and all copies, modifications and derivative works thereof. Ownership and license of any code submitted by you to the
Service shall be as governed under the Terms of Service. You acknowledge that you are obtaining only a limited
license right to the Software and that irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale” or like terms hereunder
no ownership rights are being conveyed to you under this Agreement or otherwise.

4.	Term of Agreement.

4.1	Term. This Agreement is effective upon your first use of the Software (or, if earlier, upon your agreement to
these terms by clicking “I Agree”) and may be terminated by either you or Agitar at any time without prior notice.
Termination is not an exclusive remedy and the exercise by either party of any remedy under this Agreement will be
without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise.

4.2	Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, you shall cease any and all use of any
Software and destroy all copies thereof. If requested by Agitar, you will so certify to Agitar in writing.

4.3	Survival. Sections 2.2 (License Restrictions), 3 (Ownership), 4 (Term of Agreement), 5 (No Warranty), 7
(Limitation of Remedies and Damages),  10 (Export Compliance) and 14 (General) shall survive any termination or
expiration of this Agreement.

5.	No Warranty.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THE SOFTWARE AND ALL SERVICES
ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”. NEITHER AGITAR NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES,
CONDITIONS OR UNDERTAKINGS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NONINFRINGEMENT. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, TO THE FULL EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE
LIMITED TO THE LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD.

6.	No Support & Maintenance. Agitar may make available on-line bulletin board support, but Agitar shall not be
obligated to continue provide any support and maintenance services related to the Software.

7	Limitation of Remedies and Damages.

7.1	NEITHER YOU NOR AGITAR (INCLUDING AGITAR’S SUPPLIERS) SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS
OF USE, LOST DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST
PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. THIS SECTION 7.1 SHALL NOT APPLY TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM
ARISING UNDER THE SECTIONS TITLED “GRANT OF LICENSE,” “LICENSE RESTRICTIONS” OR
“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION”.

7.2 	NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, AGITAR AND ITS SUPPLIERS’
ENTIRE LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED $1,000.

7.3	The parties agree that the limitations specified in this Section 7 will survive and apply even if any limited
remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

10.	Export Compliance. You acknowledge that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the United States
government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. You shall not, and shall not allow any third-party
to, remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct
product thereof: (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (ii) to anyone on
the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated
Nationals; (iii) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the United
States government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of
export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (iv) otherwise in violation of any export or import
restrictions, laws or regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority. You agree to the foregoing and
warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on
any such prohibited party list. The Software is further restricted from being used for the design or development of
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology, or for terrorist activity, without the prior permission of
the United States government.

party’s prior written consent.

11.9	Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation
under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events, which occur
after the signing of this Agreement and which are beyond the reasonable control of the parties, such as strikes,
blockade, war, terrorism, riots, natural disasters, refusal of license by the government or other governmental
agencies, in so far as such an event prevents or delays the affected party from fulfilling its obligations and such party
is not able to prevent or remove the force majeure at reasonable cost.
