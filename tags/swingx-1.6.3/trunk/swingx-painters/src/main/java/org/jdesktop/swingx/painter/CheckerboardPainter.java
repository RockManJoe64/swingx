/**
 * <p>A Painter implementation that paints a checkerboard pattern. The light
 * and dark colors (Paint instances) are configurable, as are the size of the
 * squares (squareSize).</p>
 * 
 * <p>To configure a checkerboard pattern that used a gradient for the dark
 * tiles and Color.WHITE for the light tiles, you could:
 * <pre><code>
 *  GradientPaint gp = new GradientPaint(
 *      new Point2D.Double(0, 0),
 *      Color.BLACK,
 *      new Point2D.Double(0, 32),
 *      Color.GRAY);
 *  CheckerboardPainter p = new CheckerboardPainter();
 *  p.setDarkPaint(gp);
 *  p.setLightPaint(Color.WHITE);
 *  p.setSquareSize(32);
 *  panel.seBackgroundPainter(p);
 * </code></pre></p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that in this example, the "32" in the GradientPaint matches the "32"
 * set for the squareSize. This is necessary because GradientPaints don't
 * readjust themselves for the size of the square. They are fixed and immutable
 * at the time of creation.</p>
