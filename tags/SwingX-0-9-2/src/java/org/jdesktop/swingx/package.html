      Contains extensions to the Swing GUI toolkit, including new and enhanced
      components that provide functionality commonly required by rich, 
      data-centric client applications.  Highlights include:
      <ul>
        <li>Sorting, filtering, highlighting for tables, trees, and lists</li>
        <li>Find/search</li>
        <li>Auto-completion for textfields</li>
        <li>Login/authentication framework</li>
        <li>TreeTable component</li>
        <li>Collapsible panel component</li>
        <li>Date picker component</li>
        <li>Tip-of-the-Day component</li>
      </ul>
      Many of these features will eventually be incorporated into the Swing
      toolkit, although API compatibility will not be guaranteed.
