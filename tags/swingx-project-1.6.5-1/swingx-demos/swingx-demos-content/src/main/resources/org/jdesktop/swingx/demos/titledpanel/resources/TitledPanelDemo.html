       Demonstrates features of a JXTitledPanel. <p>
       
       All title area's properties - f.i. Font, BackgroundPainter - can be configured. 
       Besides the title, it has properties left/right decoration which take
       arbitrary JComponents which are fully interactive controls. In this
       demo they are used to implement a card-layout like control.
