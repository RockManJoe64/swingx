<h2><a name="Introduction_"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The most common use of a tree table component is to display a
hierarchical list of objects. In this usage, each row represents an
object, and each column represents some attribute of that object.
Additionally, an object may have one or more "child" objects which are
shown indented beneath the "parent" object.<br>
</p>
<p>Note: "object" means an
object in the mind of the user (file, appointment, breakpoint, etc),
not a java.lang.Object.</p>
<p>This document is a user interface specification for that usage of a
TreeTable in JDNC (called a Hierarchical Object List in this document).
It contains sections for all the behaviors and the appearance details
of that usage, with sub-sections for four different looks and feels
(JLF/Ocean, Windows XP, GNOME 2.x and Macintosh OS X 10.3).<br>
</p>
<p>Note: JDNC will not deliver a Macintosh look and feel. This is
documented here to help demonstrate the breadth of features the
component must be able to support, and to provide guidance to anyone
that would like to provide this support.<br>
</p>
<p>This specification covers two categories of details. The first
is information that must be provided by the component itself. The
second category is information that an application developer can use to
make their application more professional and to avoid "re-inventing the
wheel" for these common design decisions.<br>
</p>
Note that after the Overview section, the terms MUST, SHOULD and MAY in
this document have the formal meaning found in <a
 href="http://rfc.net/rfc2119.html">http://rfc.net/rfc2119.html</a>. <br>
<br>
Much of the information about what is standard on the various platforms
comes from some demo applications. These are provided for <a
 href="ol/gtktvapp.tar">GNOME/GTK+2.0</a>, <a href="ol/mac.zip">Macintosh</a>.<br>

<p>A list must allow 0 or 1, or multiple rows to be selected.
Continuous and
discontinuous sets of rows may be selected.<br>

<p>When a row is selected, the whole row must be selected.<br>
</p>
<p>One term will be useful to understand the rules below:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anchor
row: a row that the underlying software uses to determine where to make
continuous selections from. The user is never given any feedback to
indicate which row is the anchor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Details For <img alt="WindowsXP" src="ol/winxp.gif"
 style="width: 120px; height: 24px;"></h4>
<p>These are the rules for row selection with the keyboard and mouse.
These have been derived from those in the Windows Explorer list view.
Aside from
being reasonably well defined and internally consistent, this is also
the model used
by other Swing components in the Windows look and feel.<br>
</p>
<p>There are written standards for <a
 href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/appxA.asp">Mouse</a>
and <a
 href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/appxB.asp">Keyboard</a>
interfaces in <a
 href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/welcome.asp">The
Microsoft Windows User Experience</a> book. However, the list
view doesn't fully adhere to those guidelines. These links are provided
just for reference.<br>
</p>
<p>The component must support two editing modes (detailed further
below). The gestures below assume either that the cell clicked on is a
non-editable cell, or the list is in select-click-to-edit mode. (this
will make more sense when you read that editing section)<br>
</p>
<p>This table documents the location of the focus indicator. Note that
the focus indicator is not always shown to the user.<br>

<p>Other notes:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The keyboard focus indicator's visibility is controlled on a
window basis. The general rules are:<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>It is not shown when a window is first displayed or when it is
brought to the foreground (nor is it shown when the window is in the
background).</li>
    <li>Any time a keydown event occurs in the window, the focus
indicator will be shown (if appropriate) on the currently focused
component.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Certain keys, however, have an immediate effect, and that
action more or less captures the keydown so that the window doesn't get
it and thus doesn't show the keyboard focus indicator (e.g. Alt,
certain F-keys)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>When an arrow key is pressed, the focus marker must be moved to
the cell above (up-arrow) or below (down-arrow) the cell that had the
keyboard focus marker before the key was pressed.</li>
  <li>The Home key must behave just like using the up arrow key, in the
table
above, except that instead of moving one row up, it moves to the first
row (and the first column) in the list. Thus, unmodified Home
must select the first row
in the list and
deselects all others, Ctrl-Home must move the keyboard focus to the
first
row and changes no selection, etc.</li>
  <li>The End key must be like the Home key except it affects the last
row (and last column) in the list.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The PageUp key must behave just like using the up arrow key,
except that it moves the selection and focus to the first whole
row (unchanged column) visible on the
screen, and if it is already on that row the view must automatically
scroll to the topmost visible row (unchanged column) on the next
view-full of information
(in that case, the row that was at the top should be kept as the last
whole visible row in the scrolled view).</li>
  <li>The PageDown key must be like the PageUp key except it affects
the last visible row (unchanged column)in the list.</li>
  <li>If the focus indicator is in the first row in the list
then pressing the up arrow, home, or PageUp keys must have no
effect. If it is in the last row, then down arrow, End and
PageDown must have no effect.</li>
  <li>If the rows are not draggable, the left drag must always be
treated like a
click.</li>
  <li>If the list allows only one row to be selected at a time, then
the shift and ctrl modifiers must be ignored and all behavior should
be like an unmodified click, arrow key, or space.</li>
  <li>Applications must ignore modifier keys on a right click.</li>
  <li>Applications may provide a "Select All" command (generally
Ctrl-A) which selects all the rows in the list (but doesn't affect the
anchor)</li>
  <li>Applications must assure that a right click will have the same
effect as an unmodified left
click excpet that a contextual menu must be shown on mouseUp and any
other mouseUp behavior (e.g. deselection) is not done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ordinarily the component provides a keyboard focus in the individual
cells. This allows the component to provide a way to manipulate
the size and
ordering of the columns from the keyboard in a cross-platform
manner. However, the component should provide a mode where the
keyboard focus spans all cells of a row, which is more consistent with
the Windows style. In this case, however, it the columns must not be
able to be resized or repositioned.</p>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<p>This image demonstrates a multiple selection, and the keyboard focus
on the third row. Note: This is a mockup, which is based on a
combination of the behavior in Windows Explorer details view, and the
feedback in some of the MMC plugins (e.g. Event Viewer)<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="selection" src="ol/selection1-winxp.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 511px; height: 117px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This demonstrates the same list, but with the keyboard focus moved
out of the selection (this also is a mockup):<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="keyboard focus outside" src="ol/selection2-winxp.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 511px; height: 117px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This demonstrates the same list when some other component has the
focus. Unsurprisingly, the keyboard focus is not shown at all.
This is also a mockup, but note that the blue-tinted icons on the left
are actually what Windows does in the Explorer.<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="Not focused" src="ol/selection3-winxp.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 511px; height: 117px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This demonstrates the keyboard focus existing in a single cell,
which should be used any time there are editable cells. This is
emphatically a mockup.<br>

<h4>Details For <img alt="Java Emblem" src="ol/java-cropped.gif"
 style="width: 13px; height: 24px;"><br>
</h4>
<p>The JLF/Ocean behaviors should be identical to the Windows ones,
above, with these exceptions:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ctrl-/ must select all rows (anchor not affected)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Ctrl-\ must deselect all rows (anchor not affected)</li>
</ul>
<p>Relevant resources are the summary of shortcuts for <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed2/book/Appendix.A8.html">lists</a>
and for <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed2/book/Appendix.A22.html">trees</a>
in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed2/book/index.html">JLF
Design Guidelines</a>.<br>
</p>
<h4>Details For <img alt="Gnome Logo" src="ol/gnome.png"
 style="width: 24px; height: 24px;"><br>
</h4>
<p>The rules for keyboard navigation and row selection presented here
are derived from those in the System Monitor tree view (type
Ctrl-Alt-Del from the GNOME environment to get it). This seems to
be basically consistent in its behavior with other similar components
in the envrionment (e.g. the list view in Nautilus).<br>
</p>
<p>There is some relevant material in the GNOME standards for <a
 href="http://www.gnome.org/learn/access-guide/2.8/ch03s08.html#keynav-34">keyboard
accessibility</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>The rules are identical to the Windows ones, listed above, with
these exceptions:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ctrl-Shift Left Click must be identical to Ctrl Left Click</li>
  <li>Ctrl-Shift Up/Down Arrow must be identical to Ctrl Up/Down Arrow</li>
  <li>Shift Space must be identical to Space</li>
  <li>Ctrl-Shift Space must select nothing, deselect nothing, and not
affect the anchor</li>
  <li>The algorithm for determining what PageUp and PageDown are
different than on Windows. On GNOME, if N whole rows can be shown
in the list, then pressing PageDown must affect the Nth row down the
list (including counting the one that started with the focus). PageUp
counts the same number of rows up. (Put another way, pressing PageUp or
PageDown on GNOME always skips a fixed number of rows, while on Windows
the number of rows skipped will vary based on which row started out
with the keyboard focus).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Keyboard focus must be able to be put in the column headers</li>
  <li>If the keyboard focus indicator was showing in the component when
it last had focus, and it is again given focus, the indicator must be
visible, no matter how the component got focus.<br>
  </li>
  <li>However, the focus indicator in rows must be hidden as a result
of mouse
operations in the component, and must be shown after keyboard gestures.
[Note: This may be a bug in GNOME, since other components show the
keyboard focus after a mouse gesture]<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Appearance:<br>
<p>NOTE: The first three illustrations are of an actual use of a
component like this in GNOME. In this case, whole rows are
selected, and because no individual cells are ediable, the keyboard
focus spans the whole row. It's also interesting to note the
notable differences in sizes of text and widgets compared to Windows.<br>
</p>
<p>This image demonstrates a multiple selection, and the keyboard focus
on the fifth row.</p>
<p><img alt="Demonstration of Selection" src="ol/selection1.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 467px; height: 233px;"></p>
<p>This demonstrates the same list, but with the keyboard focus moved
out of the selection:<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="Demonstration of selection" src="ol/selection2.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 467px; height: 234px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This demonstrates the same list when some other component has the
focus. Unsurprisingly, the keyboard focus is not shown at all.</p>
<p><img alt="Demonstration of selection" src="ol/selection3.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 457px; height: 234px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This demonstrates the keyboard focus existing in a single cell,
which should be used any time there are editable cells. Note that
this behavior does not exist "natively" in GNOME, but is provided to
support the cross-platform accessibility requirements for column
reordering and sizing. This is a
simple extrapolation from the above patterns:<br>

<p>To move a column with the mouse, the user must press anywhere in the
column header and then drag the column either left or right and then
drop it wherever she wishes. Doing this never changes any other aspect
of
the list.</p>
<p>If Esc is pressed while dragging, the drag must be cancelled.</p>
<p>To move a column with the keyboard, the application must provide
Move Left and Move Right commands in the menus. The column which
contains the keyboard focus
marker must move to the right or left by one column (and the keyboard
focus must move with it). If a column is leftmost or rightmost then
the menu item(s) must be disabled.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">It would be </span><em
 style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">much</em><span

mode that a single "Move Column" command could invoke. This would start
a mode where the column could be moved with repeated presses of the
arrow keys, and any other key than Esc would exit the
mode and leave the column in place. The mouse pointer would also
moved to the center of the column header when this mode is started, and
returned to its old position when the mode is ended. This would mimic
the "Move Window" command found in Windows and GNOME. (nicer because it
clutters the menu less, and allows more rapid column movement for
keyboard users)</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: There is no standard way to move columns with the keyboard on
on any of these platforms. Several applications have dialog boxes
which allow the user to change the column order (and sometimes the
size) from there.
The method presented here is "better" since it can coexist with these
other schemes, and can be done uniformly across all platforms with a
minimum of interface overhead.</p>
<p>
When the keyboard focus spans the whole row, then the columns must not
be movable by the user.</p>
<h4>Details For <img alt="WindowsXP" src="ol/winxp.gif"
 style="width: 120px; height: 24px;"></h4>
<h5>Dragging Visual Feedback</h5>
<p>The visual feedback when dragging a column on Windows is to only
move a transparent version of the header, and to show some drop-target
feedback as this is moved. The transparent version of the header is
positioned under
the pointer so that the point the user first pressed the mouse on
remains under the pointer's hot spot.<br>
</p>
<p>There is no autoscrolling, but a column may be dropped "offscreen"
if the drop point is offscreen.<br>
</p>
<p>Before any interaction:<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="x" src="ol/move1-before.png"

<p><img alt="x" src="ol/move3-mousedown.png"
 style="width: 403px; height: 280px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Drag feedback. Node the transparent header being dragged, and note
the dark blue drop feedback indicator. If the rightmost column is
more than half-onscreen, and the header is dragged past the halfway
point, the column can be dropped offscreen.</p>
<p><img alt="x" src="ol/move4-drag.png"
 style="width: 403px; height: 280px;"><br>
</p>
<h5>Drop Regions</h5>
<p>If column A is being moved with the mouse, then when the <em>pointer</em>
is to the right of the
midpoint of any other column, B, then when column A is released it must
appear to the right of column B. If the pointer holding A is to
the left of the midpoint of column B, then A will be dropped to the
left of A.</p>
<h5>Results of Canceling The Drag</h5>
<p>When a drag is cancelled (with Esc), the user interaction must
remain
in a "dragging mode" until the mouse button is released, so that when
the pointer is next over any column header, that column will start to
be dragged.</p>

<h4>Details For <img alt="Gnome Logo" src="ol/gnome.png"
 style="width: 24px; height: 24px;"></h4>
<h5>Dragging Visual Feedback</h5>
<p>When a column is dragged in GNOME, the column header jumps down to
below the header row, leaving a gap in the header row. A black
rectangle indicates the drop location. As the pointer is moved, drop
location indicators are shown. When the column header reaches the edge
of the visible portion of the list, then if the list may be scrolled
scroll indicators are shown and the list will auto scroll left or right.</p>
<p>
In the process, the keyboard focus is transferred and displayed at the
last position it was at within the list body.<br>
</p>
<p>This shows the result of starting a drag. Note the black rectangle
indicating the drop location, and note how the header being dragged has
been placed below the header row:<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="x" src="ol/move4-drag1-gnome.png"

drop location between two other colunms:</p>

<p><img alt="x" src="ol/move6-drag3-gnome.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 350px; height: 250px;"><br>
</p>
<h5>Drop Regions</h5>
<p>Same as Windows (the drop boundary is changed when the pointer
passes the middle of a column).</p>
<h5>Results of Canceling The Drag</h5>
<p>The column is returned to its initial position. No further mouse
actions can occur until the button is released.</p>

<h5>Dragging Visual Feedback</h5>
<p>When the column is dragged, the whole column (header and contents)
is dragged onscreen. The list will autoscroll left or right if part of
the list are off the edges of the scrolling view and the pointer nears
the edge (standard Mac autoscrolling behavior happens here).</p>
<p>
Note that as the column is dragged, drop indicators are not shown.
Instead, the columns of the list are repositioned live during the drag
to
show the new drop location.<br>

<h5>Drop Regions</h5>
<p>If column A is being moved with the mouse, then when the right (or
left)<em></em> edge of the <span style="font-style: italic;">header</span>
is to the right (or left) of the
midpoint of another column, B, then when column A is released it must
appear to the right (or left) of column B.</p>
<h5>Results of Canceling The Drag</h5>
<p>Cancelling the drag is the same as simply releasing the mouse
button. It drops the column at the current location.<br>
</p>
<h4>Application Details<br>

<p>The application should remember the column order in both primary and
secondary windows across restarts of the program so
that the user is not forced to rearrange the columns every time.</p>

which would allow the user to adjust which columns are shown in the
component.</p>

<p>To resize with the mouse, the mouse pointer must be pressed in the
region between the column headers, and then dragged. The exact result
of this drag operation will depend on the resize mode for the whole
list.<br>
</p>
<p>To resize with the keyboard, the Make Narrower and Make Wider menu
commands must be used. These apply to the column that contains
the
keyboard focus. These commands change the width by 3 pixels.</p>
<blockquote><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">As with column
movement, it would be best if the component provided a "Resize Column"
mode which would operate similar to the Resize command on Windows and
GNOME. When invoked via a menu command, left and right arrow keys
would adjust the right edge of the current column, any key other than
arrows and Esc would leave the mode and leave the column at its new
width, while Esc would return the column to the original size.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
  <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">An alternate (and better-still)
strategy would be that when the mode is first invoked, the arrow keys
would first be used to choose a column to adjust, and then once that
mode was ended a mode to adjust the selected column would start. This
has the benefit of not forcing some of the unusual per-cell keyboard
focus feedback that is required elsewhere in this spec.</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p>As with column movement, there is no standard way to adjust
column widths with the keyboard on any of the platforms. This
solution doesn't
conflict with any conventions and so can be applied uniformly across
looks and feels.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>If there are child objects in the list, then they must be
sorted
within
the scope of their parent. That is, they are always kept under
their parent, and are sorted relative only to one another.
Alternately, the list may be "flattened" (that is, the hierarchy must
be removed), in which case all objects would be sorted as siblings.<br>
</p>
<p>The sort should be done on the visible content of the column (e.g.
an alphabetic or numeric sort). However, in some cases it may be
done on an underlying value. For example in a list of bugs, the "S<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span>everity" column might contain values
"Neutral", "Bad", and "Very
bad", and these should be sorted in that order rather than an
alphabetic
order (Bad, Neutral, Very bad).</p>
<p>Whenever a different column is made the sort column, the sort should
be done as a stable sort (this keeps items in the old column in the
same relative order when there are identically valued items in the new
column). This may be ignored, however, if the list is switched to an
"unsorted" state.<br>
</p>
<p>Most lists that allow sorting should require one column to be sorted
at all times. In this case, the most appropriate column should be
marked as sorted in the most appropriate direction by default. On
rare occasion, however, a list may allow an "unsorted" or
"natural order" state (this is only done for responsiveness reasons in
lists that are updated very frequently and where a user-imposed sort is
not crucial). In this case, the list may appear in the
unsorted state by default.<br>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>On very rare occasion, a set of users may have a need to sort on
multiple columns simultaneously. This specification doesn't
discuss how that should be done.<br>

<p>This shows the same column sorted descending. Note the change in the
indicator in the column header:<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="Descending Sort" src="hol_files/sort2-descend-gnome.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ;"></p>
<p>This shows a column before it becomes a sorted column:<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="Pre sorted" src="hol_files/sort3-pre-sorted-gnome.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 92px; height: 174px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This shows the same column after its header was clicked on.<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="Post sorted" src="hol_files/sort4-post-sorted-gnome.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 90px; height: 173px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Narrow columns have two behaviors, depending on whether the user has
explicitly set the width. The first illustration here shows "before"
the column is made the sort column:<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="before" src="hol_files/sort5-narrow-before-gnome.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 103px; height: 100px;"><br>
</p>
<p>If the user hasn't set the width, then when the sort indicator is
added, the column seems to resize automatically to accomodate the added
width:<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="after2" src="hol_files/sort7-resize-after-gnome.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 103px; height: 100px;"><br>
</p>
<p>However, if the user has specified the width, then the column is not
resized and the sort indicator occludes the column text (note that no
ellipses are shown).<br>

<h4>Details For<img alt="MacOS X 10.3 (Panther)"
 src="hol_files/panther.jpg" style="width: 24px; height: 24px;"></h4>
<h5>Sorting With a Mouse</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The same as Windows except: a column "remembers" its previous
sort order. Thus an initial click on the column header must
re-display that previous sort order. Subsequent clicks must cycle
through the
sort orders. The default sort order should be ascending.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Sorting With a Keyboard</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Same as Windows<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Sort Indicator Visual Feedback</h5>
<p>This shows a column sorted in ascending order. Note the sort
indicator which is always placed on the right side. Note that the
triangle points in the same direction as Windows, but opposite GNOME.<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="x" src="hol_files/sort1-ascend-panther.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 591px; height: 175px;"></p>
<p>This shows the same column sorted descending. Note the change in the
indicator in the column header:</p>
<p><img alt="x" src="hol_files/sort2-descend-panther.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 591px; height: 175px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This shows a column before it is made the sorted column:<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="x" src="hol_files/sort3-pre-sorted-panther.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 190px; height: 175px;"><br>
</p>
<p>After it is made the sorted column.<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="x" src="hol_files/sort4-post-sorted-panther.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 190px; height: 175px;"><br>
</p>
<p>A narrow column with the text fully ellided. Note that unlike
Windows, which ellides the trailing text, the Mac elides from the
middle of a string of text.<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="x" src="hol_files/sort5-narrow-before-panther.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 50px; height: 175px;"><br>
</p>
<p>After the column is made the sort column. Note that there is
always space on the sides of the header text to accomodate the sort
indicator, so displaying it never disrupts the position of the header
text.
</p>
<p><img alt="x" src="hol_files/sort6-narrow-after-panther.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 50px; height: 175px;">
</p>
<p>Open Question: Is it possible, via code, to make a column narrower
than the width of, say, the right header border area? This can't be
done with things built with IB.
</p>
<h4>Application Details</h4>
<p>A program should persist the sorted column and the sort direction
across
runs of the program in lists found in both primary and secondary
windows.
</p>
<p>The application developer must provide the Sort By menu and
accompanying behavior.
