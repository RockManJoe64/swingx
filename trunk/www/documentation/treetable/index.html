<h2><a name="Introduction_"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The most common use of a tree table component is to display a
hierarchical list of objects. In this usage, each row represents an
object, and each column represents some attribute of that object.
Additionally, an object may have one or more "child" objects which are
shown indented beneath the "parent" object.
</p>
<p>Note: "object" means an
object in the mind of the user (file, appointment, breakpoint, etc),
not a java.lang.Object.</p>
<p>This document is a user interface specification for that usage of a
TreeTable in JDNC (called a Hierarchical Object List in this document).
It contains sections for all the behaviors and the appearance details
of that usage, with sub-sections for four different looks and feels
(JLF/Ocean, Windows XP, GNOME 2.x and Macintosh OS X 10.3).
</p>
<p>Note: JDNC will not deliver a Macintosh look and feel. This is
documented here to help demonstrate the breadth of features the
component must be able to support, and to provide guidance to anyone
that would like to provide this support.
</p>
<p>This specification covers two categories of details. The first
is information that must be provided by the component itself. The
second category is information that an application developer can use to
make their application more professional and to avoid "re-inventing the
wheel" for these common design decisions.
</p>
Note that after the Overview section, the terms MUST, SHOULD and MAY in
this document have the formal meaning found in <a
 href="http://rfc.net/rfc2119.html">http://rfc.net/rfc2119.html</a>. 

Much of the information about what is standard on the various platforms
comes from some demo applications. These are provided for <a
 href="ol/gtktvapp.tar">GNOME/GTK+2.0</a>, <a href="ol/mac.zip">Macintosh</a>.

<h3><a name="Row_Selection_"></a>Row Selection
</h3>
<p>A list must allow 0 or 1, or multiple rows to be selected.
Continuous and
discontinuous sets of rows may be selected.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="0" cellpadding="2"

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>When a row is selected, the whole row must be selected.
</p>
<p>One term will be useful to understand the rules below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anchor
row: a row that the underlying software uses to determine where to make
continuous selections from. The user is never given any feedback to
indicate which row is the anchor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Details For <img alt="WindowsXP" src="ol/winxp.gif"
 style="width: 120px; height: 24px;"></h4>
<p>These are the rules for row selection with the keyboard and mouse.
These have been derived from those in the Windows Explorer list view.
Aside from
being reasonably well defined and internally consistent, this is also
the model used
by other Swing components in the Windows look and feel.
</p>
<p>There are written standards for <a
 href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/appxA.asp">Mouse</a>
and <a
 href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/appxB.asp">Keyboard</a>
interfaces in <a
 href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/welcome.asp">The
Microsoft Windows User Experience</a> book. However, the list
view doesn't fully adhere to those guidelines. These links are provided
just for reference.
</p>
<p>The component must support two editing modes (detailed further
below). The gestures below assume either that the cell clicked on is a
non-editable cell, or the list is in select-click-to-edit mode. (this
will make more sense when you read that editing section)
</p>
<p>This table documents the location of the focus indicator. Note that
the focus indicator is not always shown to the user.

<p>Other notes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The keyboard focus indicator's visibility is controlled on a
window basis. The general rules are:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>It is not shown when a window is first displayed or when it is
brought to the foreground (nor is it shown when the window is in the
background).</li>
    <li>Any time a keydown event occurs in the window, the focus
indicator will be shown (if appropriate) on the currently focused
component.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Certain keys, however, have an immediate effect, and that
action more or less captures the keydown so that the window doesn't get
it and thus doesn't show the keyboard focus indicator (e.g. Alt,
certain F-keys)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>When an arrow key is pressed, the focus marker must be moved to
the cell above (up-arrow) or below (down-arrow) the cell that had the
keyboard focus marker before the key was pressed.</li>
  <li>The Home key must behave just like using the up arrow key, in the
table
above, except that instead of moving one row up, it moves to the first
row (and the first column) in the list. Thus, unmodified Home
must select the first row
in the list and
deselects all others, Ctrl-Home must move the keyboard focus to the
first
row and changes no selection, etc.</li>
  <li>The End key must be like the Home key except it affects the last
row (and last column) in the list.
  </li>
  <li>The PageUp key must behave just like using the up arrow key,
except that it moves the selection and focus to the first whole
row (unchanged column) visible on the
screen, and if it is already on that row the view must automatically
scroll to the topmost visible row (unchanged column) on the next
view-full of information
(in that case, the row that was at the top should be kept as the last
whole visible row in the scrolled view).</li>
  <li>The PageDown key must be like the PageUp key except it affects
the last visible row (unchanged column)in the list.</li>
  <li>If the focus indicator is in the first row in the list
then pressing the up arrow, home, or PageUp keys must have no
effect. If it is in the last row, then down arrow, End and
PageDown must have no effect.</li>
  <li>If the rows are not draggable, the left drag must always be
treated like a
click.</li>
  <li>If the list allows only one row to be selected at a time, then
the shift and ctrl modifiers must be ignored and all behavior should
be like an unmodified click, arrow key, or space.</li>
  <li>Applications must ignore modifier keys on a right click.</li>
  <li>Applications may provide a "Select All" command (generally
Ctrl-A) which selects all the rows in the list (but doesn't affect the
anchor)</li>
  <li>Applications must assure that a right click will have the same
effect as an unmodified left
click excpet that a contextual menu must be shown on mouseUp and any
other mouseUp behavior (e.g. deselection) is not done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ordinarily the component provides a keyboard focus in the individual
cells. This allows the component to provide a way to manipulate
the size and
ordering of the columns from the keyboard in a cross-platform
manner. However, the component should provide a mode where the
keyboard focus spans all cells of a row, which is more consistent with
the Windows style. In this case, however, it the columns must not be
able to be resized or repositioned.</p>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<p>This image demonstrates a multiple selection, and the keyboard focus
on the third row. Note: This is a mockup, which is based on a
combination of the behavior in Windows Explorer details view, and the
feedback in some of the MMC plugins (e.g. Event Viewer)
</p>
<p><img alt="selection" src="ol/selection1-winxp.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 511px; height: 117px;">
</p>
<p>This demonstrates the same list, but with the keyboard focus moved
out of the selection (this also is a mockup):
</p>
<p><img alt="keyboard focus outside" src="ol/selection2-winxp.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 511px; height: 117px;">
</p>
<p>This demonstrates the same list when some other component has the
focus. Unsurprisingly, the keyboard focus is not shown at all.
This is also a mockup, but note that the blue-tinted icons on the left
are actually what Windows does in the Explorer.
</p>
<p><img alt="Not focused" src="ol/selection3-winxp.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 511px; height: 117px;">
</p>
<p>This demonstrates the keyboard focus existing in a single cell,
which should be used any time there are editable cells. This is
emphatically a mockup.

<h4>Details For <img alt="Java Emblem" src="ol/java-cropped.gif"
 style="width: 13px; height: 24px;">
</h4>
<p>The JLF/Ocean behaviors should be identical to the Windows ones,
above, with these exceptions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ctrl-/ must select all rows (anchor not affected)
  </li>
  <li>Ctrl-\ must deselect all rows (anchor not affected)</li>
</ul>
<p>Relevant resources are the summary of shortcuts for <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed2/book/Appendix.A8.html">lists</a>
and for <a

in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed2/book/index.html">JLF
Design Guidelines</a>.
</p>
<h4>Details For <img alt="Gnome Logo" src="ol/gnome.png"
 style="width: 24px; height: 24px;">
</h4>
<p>The rules for keyboard navigation and row selection presented here
are derived from those in the System Monitor tree view (type
Ctrl-Alt-Del from the GNOME environment to get it). This seems to
be basically consistent in its behavior with other similar components
in the envrionment (e.g. the list view in Nautilus).
</p>
<p>There is some relevant material in the GNOME standards for <a
 href="http://www.gnome.org/learn/access-guide/2.8/ch03s08.html#keynav-34">keyboard
accessibility</a>.
</p>
<p>The rules are identical to the Windows ones, listed above, with
these exceptions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ctrl-Shift Left Click must be identical to Ctrl Left Click</li>
  <li>Ctrl-Shift Up/Down Arrow must be identical to Ctrl Up/Down Arrow</li>
  <li>Shift Space must be identical to Space</li>
  <li>Ctrl-Shift Space must select nothing, deselect nothing, and not
affect the anchor</li>
  <li>The algorithm for determining what PageUp and PageDown are
different than on Windows. On GNOME, if N whole rows can be shown
in the list, then pressing PageDown must affect the Nth row down the
list (including counting the one that started with the focus). PageUp
counts the same number of rows up. (Put another way, pressing PageUp or
PageDown on GNOME always skips a fixed number of rows, while on Windows
the number of rows skipped will vary based on which row started out
with the keyboard focus).
  </li>
  <li>Keyboard focus must be able to be put in the column headers</li>
  <li>If the keyboard focus indicator was showing in the component when
it last had focus, and it is again given focus, the indicator must be
visible, no matter how the component got focus.
  </li>
  <li>However, the focus indicator in rows must be hidden as a result
of mouse
operations in the component, and must be shown after keyboard gestures.
[Note: This may be a bug in GNOME, since other components show the
keyboard focus after a mouse gesture]
  </li>
</ul>
Appearance:
<p>NOTE: The first three illustrations are of an actual use of a
component like this in GNOME. In this case, whole rows are
selected, and because no individual cells are ediable, the keyboard
focus spans the whole row. It's also interesting to note the
notable differences in sizes of text and widgets compared to Windows.
</p>
<p>This image demonstrates a multiple selection, and the keyboard focus
on the fifth row.</p>
<p><img alt="Demonstration of Selection" src="ol/selection1.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 467px; height: 233px;"></p>
<p>This demonstrates the same list, but with the keyboard focus moved
out of the selection:
</p>
<p><img alt="Demonstration of selection" src="ol/selection2.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 467px; height: 234px;">
</p>
<p>This demonstrates the same list when some other component has the
focus. Unsurprisingly, the keyboard focus is not shown at all.</p>
<p><img alt="Demonstration of selection" src="ol/selection3.png"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 457px; height: 234px;">
</p>
<p>This demonstrates the keyboard focus existing in a single cell,
which should be used any time there are editable cells. Note that
this behavior does not exist "natively" in GNOME, but is provided to
support the cross-platform accessibility requirements for column
reordering and sizing. This is a
simple extrapolation from the above patterns:
