   <p> Welcome to the SwingX project! </p> 
</div>
 
<div id="swinglabs-description">
		 <p>TBD: re-formulate the project's goals, boundaries, objectives </p> 
		 <p>The SwingX project exists to provide extensions to existing Swing components
    and Swing architecture (such as an ActionManager for helping manage Action
    instances). The SwingX project focuses exclusively on the
    raw components themselves.</p>

    <p>If you are looking for downloads and documentation on
    SwingLabs, including downloads for SwingX, 
    please visit <a href="http://swinglabs.org">SwingLabs.org</a>
		The SwingLabs.org site also contains useful tutorials,

    <p><strong>Important note:</strong> all SwingLabs core projects require 
		<strong>Java 5</strong> (JDK 1.5, "Tiger"). Some external
    developers have had success building and using the code with 
		<a href="http://retroweaver.sourceforge.net/">Retroweaver</a>.
    We are open to having backports of the projects to JDK 1.4 as a branch on our CVS tree; 
		we don't have ourselves the resources to 
    commit to this - if you have the time and interest, please contact us on the 
    <a href="https://swinglabs.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView" title="SwingLabs discussion forum">SwingLabs discussion forum</a>.

		<p class="question"> ... get the most current code? </p>
    <p class="answer"> Check out from cvs or pull the 
    <a href="http://javadesktop.org/cruisecontrol/">automated builds</a>. They come in 
		two variants: a weekly version created every Saturday and a current version created
		after every commit to the codebase.
