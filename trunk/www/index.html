    <b>Welcome to the SwingX project!</b>
    
    <p><strong>If you are looking for downloads and documentation on
    SwingLabs, including downloads for SwingX, 
    please visit <a href="http://swinglabs.org">SwingLabs.org</a>
    </strong>. The SwingLabs.org site also contains useful tutorials,
    links, and information on how to contribute.</p>
    
    <p>The SwingX project exists to provide extensions to existing Swing components
    and Swing architecture (such as an ActionManager for helping manage Action
    instances). The SwingX project focuses exclusively on the
    raw components themselves.</p>
    
    <p>The following are some useful links to some very hacker-oriented content.
    If you are interested in <em>using</em> SwingX, visit the main
    <a href="http://swinglabs.org">SwingLabs.org</a> website. If you are interested
    in the project planning and process, check out these links:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="SwingXTodo.html">TODO list</a></li>
        <li><a href="SwingX1.0ReleasePlanning.html">Release Planning list (maybe out of date?)</a></li>
        <li><a href="enhancements.html">Visual enhancements to SwingX components</a></li>
        <li><a href="documentation/treetable/index.html">Next Generation TreeTable UI Specification</a></li>
    </ul>    
        
    <p>Important note: SwingX requires Java 5 (JDK 1.5, "Tiger"). Some external
    developers have had success building and using SwingX using <a href="http://retroweaver.sourceforge.net/">Retroweaver</a>.
    We are open to having a backport of SwingX to JDK 1.4 as a branch on our CVS tree; we don't have ourselves have the resources to 
    commit to this--if you have the time and interest, please contact us on the 
    <a name="JDNC Mailing List" href="https://jdnc.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList" title="JDNC mailing list URL">project mailing list</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Also, check out our most current documentation on the
    <b><a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Javadesktop/SwingLabs">SwingLabs Wiki</a></b> page.
