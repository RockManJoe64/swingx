/**
 * <p>A Painter that paints java.awt.Shapes. It uses a stroke and a fillPaint to do so. The
 * shape is painted as is, at a specific location. If no Shape is specified, nothing
 * will be painted. If no stroke is specified, the default for the Graphics2D
 * will be used. If no fillPaint is specified, the component background color
 * will be used. The shape can be positioned using the insets, horizontal, and
 * vertical properties.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Here is an example that draws a rectangle aligned on the center right:
 * <pre><code>
 *  Rectangle2D.Double rect = new Rectangle2D.Double(0, 0, 50, 50);
 *  ShapePainter p = new ShapePainter(rect);
 * p.setHorizontal(HorizontalAlignment.RIGHT);
 * p.setVertical(VerticalAlignment.CENTER);
 * </code></pre>
