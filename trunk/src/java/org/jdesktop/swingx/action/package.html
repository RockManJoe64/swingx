    Contains classes related to the JDNC actions architecture. The Actions 
    architecture maintains the set of user initiated commands (referred to as 
    <i>user actions</i>) in an application. These commands are represented as an 
    {@link javax.swing.Action} and have properties like name and icon. The 
    user actions
    are represented in the user interface by controls like menu items and 
    toolbar buttons.
    <p>
      The other type of actions used by the architecture are the internal 
      swing Actions (refered to as <i>behaviour actions</i>) that are embedded
      within the {@link javax.swing.ActionMap} of a {@link javax.swing.JComponent}.
    <p>
      These two types of actions are distinct from each other: user actions
      have a lot of properties but very little semantics by default 
      (unless explicity bound). Behavior actions have no properties but have
      semantics. These two types of actions are linked by the action id 
      which is the value of the <code>Action.ACTION_COMMAND_KEY</code>
    <p>
      The {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.actions.AbstractActionExt} class extends the Swing
      concept of the Action by adding support for toggle or two state actions.
      Toggle type actions may be grouped into a set of mutually exclusive actions.
      This binary actions are represented in the user interface as JToggleButtons,
      JCheckBoxMenuItems or JRadioButtonMenuItems. 
    <p>
      There are two types of user actions: A {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.actions.BoundAction} 
      is an action that will invoke a specific method. It may be bound to an explict
      component, a callback method on an object instance or one or more listeners. 
      A {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.actions.TargetableAction} is an action that doesn't have an
      explicit binding and the invocation will be sent to an arbitrator 
      (the {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.actions.TargetManager}) which dispatches the Action 
      to the "current component" - represented by a Targetable instance. 
      The current component may be explictly set by some programmatic 
      policy (for example, changes in state).
    <p>
      By defalt, the current component will be driven by the focus policy as dictated 
      by the current FocusManager. If the current component cannot handle the action 
      then the action will be dispatched up the containment hierarchy until the action 
      is consumed. If the action is not consumed then it will be dispatched to the 
      Application instance which manages an application global set of actions.
    <p>
      These are the key classes or the actions architecture:
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt> {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.actions.ActionManager}</dt>
      <dd> A repository of all shared actions in the application.
	There will be one instance per application which can be accessed
	via the Application object (was ClientApp)
      </dd>

      <dt>{@link org.jdesktop.swingx.actions.ActionContainerFactory}</dt>
      <dd>Constructs JMenuBars, JMenus, JPopupMenus and
	JToolBars using lists of action ids. This functionality may
	be migrated into ActionManager.
      </dd>

      <dt>{@link org.jdesktop.swingx.actions.TargetableAction}</dt>
      <dd>Represents an unbound Action. The invocation of this action
	will be dispatched to the TargetManager.</dd>

      <dt>{@link org.jdesktop.swingx.actions.BoundAction}</dt>
      <dd>Represents an action which has an exclicit binding.</dd>

      <dt>{@link org.jdesktop.swingx.actions.TargetManager}</dt>
      <dd>Manages the targetable policy for actions which have no
	explicit binding. The policy can be set by changes in application
	state, event based criteria or whatever. If the policy has not been
	set then it will dispatch the action to the current focusable
	component.
      </dd>

      <dt>{@link org.jdesktop.swingx.actions.Targetable}</dt>
      <dd>An interface that contains a few methods which expose actions to
	the TargetManager. Targetable objects don't have to be visual
	components they only have to be able to handle action invocations.
      </dd>
    </dl>
