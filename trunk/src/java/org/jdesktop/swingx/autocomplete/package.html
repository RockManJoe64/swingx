    Contains classes to enable automatic completion for JComboBox and
    other components.
    <p>
    The easiest way to get automatic completion for a component is to use the
    {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.autocomplete.Configurator Configurator}.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you want to enable automatic completion for a component that is not 
    supported by the {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.autocomplete.Configurator Configurator}, you
    need to implement {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.autocomplete.CommonModel CommonModel}. For
    an example see {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.autocomplete.JComboBoxAdaptor JComboBoxAdaptor}
    and {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.autocomplete.JListAdaptor JListAdaptor}.
    </p>
    <p>
    The automatic completion works only for subclasses of
    {@link javax.swing.text.JTextComponent JTextComponent}. So you either use a component
    that contains a JTextComponent (e.g. JComboBox) or you connect a
    JTextComponent with another component (e.g. a JTextField and a JList).
    Of course, it's also possible to enable automatic completion for a
    JTextComponent  without another visual component.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have a custom implementation of
    {@link org.jdesktop.swingx.autocomplete.CommonModel CommonModel}, you
    normally would only have to make three more calls:
    </p>
    <p>
    <code>
    CommonModel model = new YourAdaptor(...);</br>
    Document document = new Document(model, true); // or false if you need non-strict matching</br>
    Configurator.configureTextComponent(yourTextComponent, document, model);
    </code>
    </p>
