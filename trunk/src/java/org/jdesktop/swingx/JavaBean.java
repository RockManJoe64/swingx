/**
 * <p>A convenience class from which to extend all non-visual JavaBeans. It
 * manages the PropertyChange notification system, making it relatively trivial
 * to add support for property change events in getters/setters.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here is a simple example bean that contains one property, foo, and the
 * proper pattern for implementing property change notification:
 * <pre><code>
 *  public class ABean extends JavaBean {
 *    private String foo;
 *    
 *    public void setFoo(String newFoo) {
 *      String old = getFoo();
 *      this.foo = newFoo;
 *      firePropertyChange("foo", old, getFoo());
 *    }
 *
 *    public String getFoo() {
 *      return foo;
 *    }
 *  }
 * </code></pre></p>
 *
 * <p>You will notice that "getFoo()" is used in the setFoo method rather than
 * accessing "foo" directly for the gets. This is done intentionally so that if
 * a subclass overrides getFoo() to return, for instance, a constant value the
 * property change notification system will continue to work properly.</p>
 *
 * <p>The firePropertyChange method takes into account the old value and the new
 * value. Only if the two differ will it fire a property change event. So you can
 * be assured from the above code fragment that a property change event will only
 * occur if old is indeed different from getFoo()</p>
 * 
 * <p><code>JavaBean</code> also supports {@link VetoablePropertyChange} events. 
 * These events are similar to <code>PropertyChange</code> events, except a special
 * exception can be used to veto changing the property. For example, perhaps the
 * property is changing from "fred" to "red", but a listener deems that "red" is 
 * unexceptable. In this case, the listener can fire a veto exception and the property must
 * remain "fred". For example:
 * <pre><code>
 *  public class ABean extends JavaBean {
 *    private String foo;
 *    
 *    public void setFoo(String newFoo) throws PropertyVetoException {
 *      String old = getFoo();
 *      this.foo = newFoo;
 *      fireVetoableChange("foo", old, getFoo());
 *    }
 *
 *    public String getFoo() {
 *      return foo;
 *    }
 *  }
 * 
 *  public class Tester {
 *    public static void main(String... args) {
 *      try {
 *        ABean a = new ABean();
 *        a.setFoo("fred");
 *        a.addVetoableChangeListener(new VetoableChangeListener() {
 *          public void vetoableChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) throws PropertyVetoException {
 *            if ("red".equals(evt.getNewValue()) {
 *              throw new PropertyVetoException("Cannot be red!", evt);
 *            }
 *          }
 *        }
 *        a.setFoo("red");
 *      } catch (Exception e) {
 *        e.printStackTrace(); // this will be executed
 *      }
 *    }
 *  }
 * </code></pre></p>
