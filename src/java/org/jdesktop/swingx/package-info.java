/**
 *    Contains extensions to the Swing GUI toolkit, including new and enhanced
      components that provide functionality commonly required by rich, 
      data-centric client applications.  
      Many of these features will eventually be incorporated into the Swing
      toolkit, although API compatibility will not be guaranteed.<p>
